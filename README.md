ACR: Auto Conf Replacement
==========================

![ci](https://github.com/radare/acr/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

ACR tries to replace autoconf functionality generating a full-compatible
'configure' script (runtime flags). But using shell-script instead of m4.
This means that ACR is faster, smaller and easy to use.

ACR is released under the GPLv2 license. See 'COPYING'file.
